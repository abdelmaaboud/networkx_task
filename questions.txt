1-    Build the corresponding network (G) with Networkx
2-    What are the number of nodes, number of edges and the average
degree of the network?
3-    What is the density of the network.
4-    Find the minimum spanning tree in G and draw it.
5-    Draw the degree distribution histogram.
6-    Find the largest connected component of the network  (LC) and
answer the following questions about LC (or implement the tasks):
1.    Draw LC.
2.    What is its diameter?
3.    What is the center of LC?
4.    What is the number of clique communities with 3 nodes?
5.    What is the name of the protein that changing its status has
potentially the biggest effect on the rest of the network?
